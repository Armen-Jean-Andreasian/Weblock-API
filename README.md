# WebLock - Secure User Authentication for Web Apps

## Introduction
WebLock is a secure user authentication system designed to provide web applications with robust input validation, password checks, and encryption. It offers advanced protection against various security vulnerabilities, such as bad input, language injection, and SQL injection. This document provides an overview of the WebLock project and its key components.

## Project Overview
WebLock is a user authentication system that ensures the secure handling of user data in web applications. It focuses on the following key aspects:

### Input Validation
WebLock incorporates input validation mechanisms to prevent bad input, language injection, and SQL injection attacks. The use of the input_armor library enhances the security of the application by thoroughly checking for any types of injections in user-provided data.

### Encryption
User data, such as usernames and passwords, are encrypted before storage to ensure their confidentiality. This encryption mechanism prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information in the event of a security breach.

### User Registration
WebLock allows users to register for an account securely. During registration, user-provided data is subjected to input validation checks. After successful validation, the user's username and password are encrypted and stored in a database, ensuring that the registration process is secure.

### User Login
The user login process involves validating the entered credentials against the stored, encrypted information in the database. WebLock performs these checks to confirm the user's identity and grant or deny access to the web application. If the credentials do not match, the system provides appropriate feedback.

## Project Components
WebLock consists of the following main components:

1. **Input Validation**: Input validation is a critical part of WebLock, ensuring that any data provided by the user is thoroughly checked for potential security vulnerabilities. This component uses the input_armor library to safeguard against injection attacks.

2. **Encryption**: Encryption is employed to protect sensitive user data from unauthorized access. WebLock encrypts usernames and passwords before storing them in the database. This security measure ensures data confidentiality.

3. **User Registration**: The user registration process collects user data and validates it using input validation checks. Once the data passes validation, the system encrypts and securely stores the user's credentials.

4. **User Login**: When a user attempts to log in, the system validates the provided username and password against the encrypted information stored in the database. If the credentials match, access is granted. Otherwise, the system provides the user with feedback about the login attempt.
